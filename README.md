Assignment2-Hangman
by LIU Xianqi 61551

1.About the words file and data preparation
I got the inspiration from a real game 'Hangman' in Apple store.
Then I put the word that I didn't find out into the 'words_and_clues.csv', which follow the format as [word,clue].
Thus, I use a hashmap to store them, which make words as keys and make their clues as values.

2.Game begin
- The number of '_' represents the length of the hidden word.
- Above the hidden word, there's a clue help user to take a guess.
- Under the hidden word, there's text displaying how many lives left(10 left at the beginning).
- The bottom of the activity is the keyboard designed and created by me.
  Idea: I store 'a-z' as array in the resource, then dynamically generate them in the JAVA code.
- During the game, if user click the wrong letter, the picture above will change.
  Besides, the clicked buttons' background will be changed and disabled to prevent further unintentionally clicks.

3.Game over
- If you find the hidden word successfully, you will receive a alert message ðŸŽ‰! 
  And touch the space outside the alert dialog, the dialog will disappear.
- If you fail after 10 attempts, the picture will be a completed hangman :( but also you could see what exactly the word is.
  And you will receive a toast message. 
- Besides, when the game overs, the restart button will be visible, after clicking that you will begin with new word to guess.
